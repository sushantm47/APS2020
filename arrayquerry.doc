KAdane :
    Perform subarray functions like sum ,min ,max
    Efficiency O(n)

Segment tree:
    Height of tree->logn
    nodes->2n-1
    creation->O(n)
    query,update->logn
    Updation of value is fine but add or delete is prohibited.

Lookup table:
    Size depends on nature of problem but querry time is O(n) 

Sparse table:
    Space:nlogn
    Query time :O(1)
    Processing time:nlogn
    
Sqrt decomposition and MOâ€™s algorithm:
    Space eff:sqrt(n)
    Query time:
    All the queries are to be known in advance

Fenwick tree:
    Space eff:n
    Query eff:logn

Persistent segment tree:
